Write all the step of redux toolkit in brief.

1.   Install Redux Toolkit
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

2.   Create a Redux Slice
     A slice contains the state, reducers, and actions for a specific feature.
Use createSlice to create the slice

3.   Configure the Store
     Combine slices and configure the store using configureStore

4.   Provide the Store to the App
     Wrap your app with the <Provider> component from react-redux and pass the store

5.  Use Redux State and Dispatch Actions in Components
   Access the state with useSelector and dispatch actions with useDispatch

6. These steps cover the basics of using Redux Toolkit in a React application.
